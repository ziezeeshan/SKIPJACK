**‚ùì What is SkipJack?**
SkipJack is a symmetric key block cipher developed by the NSA, designed to secure digital communications via the Clipper chip. It operates on 64-bit data blocks with an 80-bit key, incorporating a backdoor for government access to encrypted data. This dual purpose of securing and surveilling communications stirred controversy and hindered its adoption due to privacy concerns.

**üõë Why Was SkipJack Rejected?**
SkipJack was rejected largely due to its key escrow system, which required encryption keys to be stored with the government, raising significant privacy issues. The algorithm's secrecy and the relatively short 80-bit key became points of contention, as advances in computing made it increasingly vulnerable. Moreover, the rise of more transparent and stronger encryption standards like AES further diminished SkipJack's relevance.

**üöÄ How to Enhance Security for Modern Applications**
To enhance SkipJack's security, we could increase its key length to at least 128 bits, improving its resistance to brute-force attacks. Making the algorithm open for peer review would build trust and help uncover potential weaknesses. Adopting modern encryption techniques and protocols, along with exploring quantum-resistant technologies, can ensure SkipJack's viability against future cryptographic threats.

**üñ•Ô∏è Key Outputs of Our Python Implementation of SkipJack**

Our Python code effectively demonstrates the encryption and decryption processes of the SkipJack algorithm. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the key outputs:

Plaintext to Ciphertext Conversion:

Input: The input plaintext, provided in hexadecimal format, was successfully converted into a 64-bit integer.
Output: The plaintext "0x33221100ddccbbaa" was encrypted using SkipJack, resulting in a unique ciphertext. This transformation showcases SkipJack's ability to securely alter the original data into an unintelligible format.
